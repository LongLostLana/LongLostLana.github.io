                <h2>My Future</h2>
            <h3>My High School Choice</h3>
            <p>I would like to go to Lakewood High School. Lakewood is my home school and
                it is very close by. They have an excellent volleyball program and my brother
                is at that school. He is in the special E.D. classes I would try out to be his
                best buddie. They have a great ATM program as well. They work on photoshop 
                and they make t-shirts from your designs. They have different language classes 
                and I would love to learn spanish. If I had another choice my second language 
                would be french or japanese.

                <h3>College</h3>
                <p> I haven’t yet decided what college I would want to go to but I want to go to
                    a college that is out of California. My sister went to Berklee, college of music,
                    in Boston. She said she had the best experience being in a whole new environment
                    and meeting new people. In Boston, it snows most of the time. I would want to go
                    to college where it snows too. Maybe in Colorado or somewhere else. Somewhere that
                    is out of this state.</article> </p>

                <h3>Career Interest</h3>
                <p> I’m interested in becoming a fashion, volleyball, doctor, archaeologist. But for my
                    job I would love to be a flight attendant. Being a flight attendant means you would
                    get no health insurance, travel wherever the destination is, and all you haft to do
                    is offer coke and peanuts. I would probably have to know another language but that 
                    would be worth it.</article> </p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>  I want to be successful in life. I want to get a scholarship to college, get a well
                    paid job, travel around the world, and met new people. I also want to keep my career
                    of volleyball going. I want to travel and experience new cultures. I also would love
                    to have long hair to put up into beautiful dues and live in a nice, big, updated house.
                    I would want to have my own fashion business. One of my goals is to take my mom to the
                    caribbean and go to a beach with clear water and white sand. My sister has traveled 
                    around the U.S and she has been to Italy, Greece, France, Israel and others. I want 
                    to travel to all of those places and more. My sister and I want to travel to Japan to 
                    go to a theme park based on one of my favorite movies, Spirited Away.
