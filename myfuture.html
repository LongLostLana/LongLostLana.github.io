            <h2>My Future</h2><br>
            <h3>My High School Choice</h3>
            <p>I would like to go to Lakewood High School. Lakewood is my home school and
                it is very close by. They have an excellent volleyball program and my brother
                is at that school. He is in the special E.D. classes I would try out to be his
                best buddie. They have a great ATM program as well. They work on photoshop 
                and they make t-shirts from your designs. They have different language classes 
                and I would love to learn spanish. If I had another choice my second language 
                would be french or japanese.

                <h3>College</h3>
                <p> I havenâ€™t yet decided what college I would want to go to but I want to go to
                    a college that is out of California. My sister went to Berklee, college of music,
                    in Boston. She said she had the best experience being in a whole new environment
                    and meeting new people. In Boston, it snows most of the time. I would want to go
                    to college where it snows too. Maybe in Colorado or somewhere else. Somewhere that
                    is out of this state.</article> </p>
