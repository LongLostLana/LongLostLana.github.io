        <h3>High School Choice</h3>
        <p> I would like to go to Lakewood High School. Lakewood is my home school and it is 
            very close by. They have an excellent volleyball program and my brother is at that
            school. He is in the special E.D. classes I would try out to be his best buddie.
            They have a great ATM program as well. They work on photoshop and they make t-shirts
            from your designs. They have different language classes and I would love to learn spanish.
            If I had another choice my second language would be french or japanese.</p>
